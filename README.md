## DETAILS 
Project developed using my knowledge in the Java language.
<br>This is an project developed with object orientation, some visibility modifiers and several methods.
<br>I added a few iterations to make the game work properly, but
unfortunately I couldn't overcome a hurdle which was trying to combine words with repeated letters. However, in order not to have this bug in my game, I decided to put words that didn't have repeated letters and it worked!

### Do you want to test the game? It's simple, just follow the steps:
>1 - in your gitbash use the command: git clone https://github.com/ruan-narici/java-jogoDaForca
<br>2 - In eclipse create a new java project;
<br>3 - Right click on ```SRC``` and navigate;
<br>```IMPORT > GENERAL > FILE SYSTEM > NEXT```;
<br>4 - In ```FROM DIRECTORY```, click on ```BROWSE```, ```open the folder that you cloned and select SRC```;
<br>5 - Then ```mark the CHECKBOX of the SRC``` folder and click ```FINISH```;
<br>6 - In Eclipse click on ```RUN AS JAVA APPLICATION```;

NOW WITH THE GAME WORKING, YOU JUST TYPE A LETTER THAT YOU THINK CONTAINS IN THE WORD.

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of the game is to guess the word based on the theme informed by the programmer.
<br>You have 6 lives, but if you answer incorrectly loses 1 life.
